                    <h2>Breeds</h2>
                    <p>Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth, with around 450 globally recognized dog breeds.[22][24] In the Victorian era, directed human selection developed the modern dog breeds, which resulted in a vast range of phenotypes.[17] Most breeds were derived from small numbers of founders within the last 200 years.</p>

                    <p>Since then, dogs have undergone rapid phenotypic change and have been subjected to artificial selection by humans. The skull, body, and limb proportions between breeds display more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores.</p>
